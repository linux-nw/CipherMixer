## CipherMixer
CipherMixer is a simple static website demonstrating various encryption and encoding methods like Vigenère variant, AES-256, 3DES, and Base64. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for educational and experimental purposes only — not for production use.

## Features
- Custom Vigenère variant cipher (VIG576)
- Multiple encryption algorithms selectable
- Encrypt and decrypt text with live output
- Key input for AES and 3DES methods
- Lightweight, no backend required
- Base64 encoding/decoding included

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open the HTML file in any modern browser
3. Use the interface to encrypt or decrypt text

## Notes
1. VIG576 is a substitution-based pseudo-Vigenère cipher using Unicode characters, designed purely for visual demonstration and educational purposes.
2. Pure frontend demo; no real security guarantees
3. Intended as a learning tool and concept showcase
